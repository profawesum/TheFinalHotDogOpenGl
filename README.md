# TheFinalHotDogOpenGl

We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?
It's the final hotdog
The final hotdog
Oh
We're heading for cheese (Cheese)
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
And welcome us all, yeah
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so
It's the final hotdog
The final hotdog
The final hotdog
The final hotdog
Oh
The final hotdog, oh
It's the final hotdog
The final hotdog
The final hotdog
The final hotdog
Oh
It's the final hotdog
We're leaving together
The final count down
We'll all miss her so
It's the final hotdog
It's the final hotdog
Oh
It's the final hotdog, yeah
